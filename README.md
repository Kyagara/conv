## About

This cli is based on some `ffmpeg` commands from EposVox's [WindowsMods](https://github.com/EposVox/WindowsMods) repository _(check his channel!)_, I use some of these commands from time to time and some others so I decided to make a cli since I've never made one. I plan to add some other commands from other tools like `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` that I use.

## Installation

You can install this CLI using go's `install` command: _Recommended_

```bash
go install -u github.com/Kyagara/conv@latest
```

Or, you can download a [release](https://github.com/Kyagara/conv/releases) and place it in your PATH.

## Todo

-   More comments
-   Tests
-   Add `Long` descriptions to commands
-   Add some `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` commands
