## About

This cli is based on some commands from EposVox's [WindowsMods](https://github.com/EposVox/WindowsMods) repository _(check his channel!)_, I use some of these commands from time to time and some others so I decided to make a cli since I've never made one. I plan to add some other commands from other tools like `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` that I use.

## Installation

Make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed.

```bash
go install github.com/Kyagara/conv@latest
```

## Todo

-   Tests
-   Add `Long` descriptions to commands
-   Add some `youtube-dl`/`yt-dlp` commands
